  description:  "A binary clock using multiplexed LEDs"
  how_it_works: >
    Using the internal clock, minutes and hours are counted in registers with
    an overflow comparison. An overflow in one, triggers a rising edge on the
    input of the successive register.

    The values of each register are connected to the input to a multiplexer,
    which is able to control 16 LEDs using just the 8 outputs.

    This design also allows use of the PPS input for more accurate time keeping.
    This input takes a 1 Hz clock with a rising edge on the start of each
    second.

    The hours[4:0] inputs allow setting of the hours value displayed on the
    clock when coming out of reset. This can be used for manually setting the
    time, so it can be done on the hour of any hour. It can also be used by an
    automatic time keeping controller to ensure the time is perfectly synced
    daily, for instance at 03:00 to be compatible with DST.
  how_to_test: >
    After reset, the output shows the current Hours:Minutes that have elapsed
    since coming out of reset, multiplexed across the rows of the LED array.

    The matrix is scanned for values:
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1110; cols[3:0] = 4'bMMMM;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1101; cols[3:0] = 4'bHHHM;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1011; cols[3:0] = 4'bxHHH;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b0111; cols[3:0] = 4'bxxxx;

    (M: Minutes, H: Hours, x: Unused)

    Directly out of reset, at 0:00, a scan would be:
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1110; cols[3:0] = 4'b0000;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1101; cols[3:0] = 4'b0000;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1011; cols[3:0] = 4'b0000;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b0111; cols[3:0] = 4'b0000;

    After one hour and two minutes, at 1:02, a scan would be:
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1110; cols[3:0] = 4'b0011;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1101; cols[3:0] = 4'b0010;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b1011; cols[3:0] = 4'b0000;
        rows[3:0] = 4'b0111; cols[3:0] = 4'b0000;

    The above can be sped up using the PPS (Pulse Per Second) input, as long as
    the PPS pulses are kept to 1 pulse per 2 clock cycles or slower.

    The hours input can be tested by applying the binary value of the desired
    hour. Asserting reset for at least one clock cycle, and checking the value
    of hours displayed in the matrix.
  external_hw: >
    This design expects a matrix of 16 LEDs (11 used) wired to the outputs. The
    LEDs should be wired so that current can flow from column to row.

    Optionally an real time clock or GPS device with PPS output may be connected
    to the `pps` pin for more accurate time keeping. If unused this pin must be
    pulled to ground.
