  description:  "A binary clock using multiplexed LEDs"
  how_it_works: >
    Using the internal clock, minutes and hours are counted in registers with an
    overflow comparision. An overflow in one, triggers a rising edge on the
    clock input of the successive register.

    The values of each register are connected to the input to a multiplexer,
    which is able to control 16 LEDs using just the 8 outputs.
  how_to_test: >
    after reset, the output shows the current time in BCD H:M when applied to
    a multiplexed array of LEDs
